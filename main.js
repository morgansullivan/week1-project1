var name = 'Morgan';
console.log(name);

//3. Declare two variables with number values. 
console.log("Question 3")
console.log("var x = 5;")

//   Add, subtract, multiply and divide them.

x += 3;
x -= 3;
x *= 3;
x /= 3;

//4. Declare two variables with string values. 
var loc = "Seattle";
var axn = "living";

var output = 'I am' + axn + 'in' + loc + '.'
console.log('output')

var width = 3;
var area = height * width;
console.log(area);
